Hello, thank you for taking a look at my GitHub! My Ames ML project is currently a work in progress so please understand that it may be messy and hard to understand my process at the moment. 

The dataset was taken from an old Kaggle challenge around predicting housing prices in Ames, Iowa through given variables in the dataset.

I separated the data cleaning to output datasets for certain purposes, such as:
    'wOrdinal' for non-dummified label encoded categorical variables
    There is a dummified dataset for the categorical variables with a first column drop and also another without the first column drop to feed into appropriate models such as Lasso. 

I separated the models through different 'regressionBooks'
    'regressionBook_multipleLinear' is for MLR model, 'regressionBook_randomForest' is for random forest modeling, etc...



I will look to make it more organized around my completion and presentation time. Let me know if you have any questions!
